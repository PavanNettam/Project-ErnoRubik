# Project-ErnoRubik
Simulation of Rubik's cube - The Rubik's cube is computerised 
Brefing:
In this segment of project efforts are made to simulate a Rubik’s Cube (create a computerised version of Rubik’s Cube). Colours present on the each face of the cube are taken as input with the help of graphical user interface. The user will be asked to press any of the button(s) from 1 to 12 which have got their own meaning associated with them: Each number is associated with a particular movement out of 12 possible movements with respect to a particular fixed position of cube. Each time a particular button is pressed a confirmation will be provided to the user with a label. Later if the “Generate Output” button is pressed a window will pop up showing the current configuration of the cube with the help of 6 faces of the cube.
